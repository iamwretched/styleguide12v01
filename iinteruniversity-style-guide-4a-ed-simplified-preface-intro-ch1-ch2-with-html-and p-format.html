<p>Interuniversity Style Guide for Writing Institutional Texts in English</p>
<h2>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION</h2>
<p>The first edition of the Interuniversity Style Guide for Writing Institutional Texts in English was a product of the Vives Network of Universities Language Policy Plan 2012–2014 and its publication was – and still is – an opportunity to remember two of our organisation’s guiding principles: first, that our universities should be multilingual communities whose members can demonstrate linguistic competence in a variety of languages; and second, that the Network itself is committed to making the Catalan language and our institutional and international relations more widely visible abroad.</p>
<p>Because resources of this nature need to be reviewed on a regular basis, and in response to the observations and suggestions made by the university community, this new edition has been revised from start to finish. We hope this new, improved Guide will not only continue to help users perfect their communication techniques and write better English-language texts but also respond to the ever-increasing needs of university staff to draft institutional documents in English.</p>
<p>The promotion of multilingualism is the general objective of one of the four axes in the Vives Network’s Plan and is given form in three specific objectives, two of which are important here: the improvement of the third-language communication skills of students, administrative and service staff and teaching and research staff; and the creation of English-language resources and guidelines for English language use. Amongst other initiatives, the Guide is the result of our universities’ efforts to address these specific objectives. We believe that it will play an essential role in facilitating interuniversity communication and improving the quality of the institutional English-language documents we produce for international readers. It will also help our community bolster its knowledge of the English language and acquire the linguistic competence in English that is widely considered to be necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, if there is value in the fact that twenty-two different universities can work together and eventually share a single set of homogeneous, English-language guidelines, then we have two groups of people to thank for that. First, there are the university language services who coordinated their efforts to write and revise the Guide. Building on extensive professional experience in higher education and a familiarity with our community’s terminology and with Catalan speakers’ specific needs as producers of information, the language specialists in those services have proved their ability to select and write guidelines to ensure that our English-language texts suit the purposes of international communication and exchange. And second, we should also thank the various university units which have given their feedback to help tailor the Guide to our specific communicative needs.</p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The growing internationalisation of higher education requires universities from Catalan-speaking territories to adopt new policies and practices if they are to respond to the changing global academic environment and not fall behind in terms of improved academic quality, international understanding and commercial advantage. In order to reach out to new markets and to ensure that students are attracted to our educational system, documents of many kinds – including agreements, syllabuses, advertising material and websites – now need to be produced in English, the current international lingua franca.</p>
<p>This situation places considerable demands on those responsible for writing, translating and publishing university documents. How can we ensure that the wide variety of documents produced give a uniform corporate image of the universities in accord with the quality of the services provided?</p>
<p>The Interuniversity Style Guide for Writing Institutional Texts in English intends to respond to this demand for quality. It is designed for use by the administrative, teaching and research staff and language professionals who are responsible for writing institutional texts in English. Although one section focuses on how to write clearly, the word style in the title refers not to literary style but to those linguistic conventions concerning spelling, punctuation, typographical display and other editorial issues that are essential for consistent, clear and precise language and layout. Consistency in these areas leads to clarity and cohesion which, in turn, makes documents more straightforward for readers. As transmitters of knowledge, universities have to be rigorous in their use of language so that they can fulfil the scientific purpose of describing reality and making the complexity of this reality more readily understandable.</p>
<p>Loosely modelled on existing style manuals (the English Style Guide of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation, The Chicago Manual of Style, The Oxford Manual of Style, etc.), this guide is organised into sections dealing with spelling, punctuation, capitalisation, abbreviations and symbols, numbers, gender, singular and plural, translation, writing in English, tools for digital text production and model documents. It also contains three appendices: common abbreviations, unusual plural forms and Latin terms with English equivalents. Throughout the text we use two simple conventions to indicate examples of incorrect language: sentences are preceded by an asterisk while short phrases are crossed out.</p>
<p>Stylistically inappropriate sentences, on the other hand, are introduced by the words Therefore, not and followed by the word but and a new, more appropriate sentence.</p>
<p>Do not use a colon to substitute a comma. Therefore, not</p>

<p>To complete your admission application, send the required documents by the end of the month.</p>
<p>We trust that the guidance and recommendations provided within these pages will be of help to anyone who has the task of preparing English-language texts and that this guide will become part of daily working life for many.</p>
<h2>SPELLING</h2>
<p>Many questions related to spelling can be resolved simply by referring to a dictionary or using a good computer spellchecker. But there are also issues that require more careful consideration and that cannot be resolved automatically. This section of the Guide provides recommendations on such issues, including the general conventions applicable to spelling, such as use of British and American variants, and the consequences of these conventions (for example, ligatures and consonant doubling). By “American” here we refer to the English written in the United States of America. There are other American Englishes in Canada and the Caribbean, and other Englishes around the world, but in regard to spelling the British and American (USA) variants are the dominant alternatives. We also refer to other considerations that are not strictly in the province of spelling but that nevertheless affect the way the language is written; issues here include the use or non-use of diacritics, italics and hyphens.</p>
<h3>Conventions</h3>
<p>As a reflection of our European geographical situation, we recommend the use of British English in most contexts, particularly for institutional documents. Some universities within the Vives Network of Universities have opted to use British English combined with so-called Oxford spelling, which is based on the Oxford Dictionary. In certain ways, it is similar to spelling in American English; in others, it resembles British spelling conventions. Details are given in Section 1.1.1.</p>
<p>In some situations, many university texts may be addressed specifically to American readers or may be for or from an academic ambit in which American English is more usual. In such cases, use common sense and discretion in deciding which variant is more suitable.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend, however, that only one variant of English be used within a single text or related series of texts, for reasons of coherence.</p>
<p>Differences in spelling between British and American English</p>
<p>For most general purposes, there is little significant difference between British and American English in written texts. In practically all circumstances, any text written in standard British English will be comprehensible to an American reader, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Historically, in British usage both the ise and ize spellings have been accepted in verbs like organise/organize and recognise/recognize and other parts of speech derived from them (organisation/organization and recognisable/recognizable). The ise spelling is used more frequently in a broad range of publications. Therefore, we recommend that the ise, yse and isation forms be used, except where the context specifically requires American spelling.</p>
<p>As we stated in Section 1.1 above, some universities within the Vives Network have opted to use British English with Oxford spelling. In the following paragraphs, we will highlight the spelling differences and similarities between British English, with and without Oxford spelling, and American English.</p>
<h3>British		Oxford		American</h3>
<p>authorise	authorize	authorize</p>
<p>authorisation	authorization	authorization</p>
<p>digitise	digitize	digitize</p>
<p>digitisation	digitization	digitization</p>
<p>finalise	finalize	finalize</p>
<p>finalising	finalizing	finalizing</p>
<p>globalise	globalize	globalize</p>
<p>globalisation	globalization	globalization</p>
<p>The Greek root lys, found in British English verbs like analyse, is also conserved in Oxford spelling. American English equivalents (analyze) are again the result of standardisation reforms. Some other verbs that follow this pattern are listed below.</p>
<h3>British		Oxford		American</h3>
<p>catalyse	catalyse	catalyze</p>
<p>electrolyse	electrolyse	electrolyze</p>
<p>paralyse	paralyse	paralyze</p>
<p>Remember, however, that British English, Oxford spelling and American English all spell certain words always with an s or with a z. In the case of s, this happens when ise is not a complete suffix but a fragment of a longer component like cise, mise, prise or vise, often from French past participles. Some of the more relevant ones are listed below.</p>
<p>advertise</p>
<p>advise</p>
<p>compromise</p>
<p>disguise</p>
<p>enterprise</p>
<p>exercise</p>
<p>improvise</p>
<p>merchandise</p>
<p>supervise</p>
<p>surprise</p>
<p>televise</p>
<p>revise</p>
<p>In the case of the letter z, this happens with a small number of words including</p>
<p>prize and size.</p>
<p>The following summary lists other well-known and now commonly accepted distinctions between British and American spelling.</p>
<h3>British English		American English</h3>
<p>ce (defence)		 se (defense)</p>
<p>our (colour)		or (color)</p>
<p>re (centre)		er (center)</p>
<p>Also, note that British usage has the form programme (as opposed to the American program) except when referring to computer code, in which case program is preferred.</p>
<p>igatures</p>
<p>Although the æ/œ spelling (known as a ligature, in which two or more letters are graphically combined) for more technical words (e.g., oestrogen, caesium, haematology or orthopaedics) is still in use in British English, this is now not universally the case for most other words that were traditionally written with a ligature; these words now have a single written vowel that substitutes the older æ form (medieval and encyclopedia being well-known examples). Opt for the simplified spelling for all such non-technical words.</p>
<p>Double consonants before suffixes</p>
<p>Where consonants are doubled for monosyllabic words (basically, after a short vowel and immediately before a suffix beginning with a vowel such as ing, er, est or ed), British and American English spelling is the same.</p>
<p>flat	flattest</p>
<p>stop	stoppable</p>
<p>shop	shopping</p>
<p>For words of more than one syllable, however, British and American usage can differ.</p>
<p>The letter l</p>
<p>As an indication for when to double this final consonant in British English, we replicate the explanation given in Section 1.5 of the English Style Guide of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation (see Bibliography): “In British usage, a final l is doubled after a short vowel on adding ing or ed to verbs (sole exception: parallel, paralleled) and adding er to make nouns from verbs”.</p>
<p>Examples would include the following:</p>
<p>Membership will probably level off by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Student interest in the new programmes has levelled off since January.</p>
<p>All those wishing to travel under the terms of the new grant should contact the International Office.</p>
<p>This regulation applies to administrative staff who travelled during the first semester.</p>
<p>Model your task on one of the following diagrams.</p>
<p>Project modellers will need a minimum of five years’ experience.</p>
<p>In American English, except for words ending in al (final/finally; minimal/minimally), l is usually not doubled before a suffix.</p>
<p>travel, traveling, traveled, traveler model, modeling, modeled, modeler level, leveling, leveled, leveler</p>
<p>Finally, there are certain words ending in l in British English which double this consonant in American English:</p>
<h3>British English		American English</h3>
<p>enrol			enroll</p>
<p>fulfil			fulfill</p>
<p>appal			appall</p>
<p>Note that the l is accordingly doubled or not in derivatives ending in ment:</p>
<h3>British English		American English</h3>
<p>enrolment		enrollment</p>
<p>fulfilment		fulfillment</p>
<p>Other consonants</p>
<p>Usage may vary considerably between British and American English in the doubling of a consonant other than l at the end of a word. If in doubt, consult a reliable English dictionary. However, the following observations generally hold for both variants. The consonants t and r double before ed and ing if the last syllable of the root word is stressed.</p>
<p>The Department will admit students who meet the following requirements.</p>
<p>The Dean admitted that faculty disruptions were inevitable.</p>
<p>Students must submit their assignments in the agreed format.</p>
<p>Applicants who are submitting their papers in June should fill in the following form.</p>
<p>The Rector will confer an honorary doctorate on two renowned sociologists. The University has rarely conferred such degrees in this academic field.</p>
<p>Faculty members will refer all complaints to the Dean.</p>
<p>Reliable international research should be referred to for clarification.</p>
<p>In contrast, for two-syllable words whose first syllable is stressed, the final consonant is not doubled.</p>
<p>open</p>
<p>opening</p>
<p>opened</p>
<p>focus</p>
<p>focusing</p>
<p>focused</p>
<p>target</p>
<p>targeting</p>
<p>targeted</p>
<p>In British English, the exception to this are two-syllable words ending in p, where the final consonant is doubled even when the principal stress is on the first syllable.</p>
<p>The new dean plans to equip laboratories with the latest technology. The science labs are equipped with state-of-the-art instruments.</p>
<h3>Diacritics</h3>
<p>Diacritics are marks added above or below a letter (or sometimes within or between letters). In the Roman alphabet, they are basically used to indicate a modification in the pronunciation of the letter in question.</p>
<p>Unlike some European languages, which make use of a large number of diacritics, modern English does not have any. However, some borrowed words may be written in English with their original non-English diacritic. The most common are the so-called grave (`) or acute (´) accents, the cedilla (¸), the umlaut/dieresis (¨), the tilde (~) and the circumflex (^), but they rarely affect pronunciation (for exceptional cases, see Section 1.2.1 Ambiguity). Overall, borrowed words tend to lose their diacritics over time because of processes of simplification and assimilation, and the fact that diacritics are not easily typed on an English keyboard.</p>
<h3>Ambiguity</h3>
<p>Use diacritics when their absence could result in ambiguity. For example, exposé, résumé and rosé, when unaccented, look like different words (in this case, expose, resume and rose, respectively). In many cases, when there is no possible ambiguity, you do not need to use the original diacritic (for example, facade, deja-vu or doppelganger). In other cases, however, assimilated foreign words, including some borrowed from French (for example, attaché, communiqué and soufflé) and, increasingly, from Spanish (jalapeño and piñata), often keep the original diacritic.</p>
<h3>Names</h3>
<p>With names in other languages, use all the diacritics correctly and consistently.</p>
<h3>Therefore,</h3>
<p>Please contact Dr González Martí, assistant rector for Communication, for further information.</p>
<p>The plenary talk was given by Professor Johan Lübeck, a specialist in medieval German manuscripts.</p>
<p>Other words</p>
<p>When an English text uses foreign words or phrases that are not names but that have diacritics in the original language, you should either keep all such marks or else use none at all. Be consistent. If you decide to use them, remember that they should also be used on capital letters.</p>

<h3>Italics</h3>
<p>Italics are often used to emphasise words or phrases.</p>
<p>Remember that you will only have five minutes to present your conclusion. All assignments must be handed in by Friday 11 May.</p>
<p>However, we generally recommend restricting their use to the following cases.</p>
<p>Titles of books, journals and other publications</p>
<p>Unless following specific editorial guidelines, write the titles of books, journals and other published materials such as dictionaries and reference works in italics, to distinguish the titles from the rest of the sentence.</p>
<p>Recent research into the applications of microbial cyanobacteria on oil pollution has been published in the latest edition of the prestigious journal Science Today.</p>
<p>Be aware, however, that conventions for indicating the title of a book or journal may vary depending on the publication or academic field. You will therefore have to bear these factors in mind, depending on the purpose of your text and where it will be published. For additional comment, see Section 3.2.2 Publications and the Bibliography.</p>
<p>Words and expressions in other languages</p>
<p>Italicise words or expressions from other languages that are not common in English (that is, words not included in a reliable English dictionary) and that may therefore not be readily understood.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the Faculty’s Aula Magna offers visitors a beautiful example of Catalan Modernisme.</p>
<p>Other expressions of this kind are the Latin terms for academic distinction cum laude, magna cum laude and summa cum laude (meaning “with honour”, “with great honour” and “with highest honour”, respectively), which should be italicised.</p>
<p>But note that foreign words that have now become common in English do not require italics.</p>
<p>addendum</p>
<p>ad hoc</p>
<p>alma mater</p>
<p>attaché</p>
<p>avant-garde</p>
<p>communiqué</p>
<p>force majeure</p>
<p>in vivo</p>
<p>status quo</p>
<p>vice versa</p>
<p>zeitgeist</p>
<p>Note also that, in the event of using a non-English form for the official name of an organisation (universities, companies, governmental bodies, etc.), these names are not written in italics.</p>
<p>The University is currently involved in discussions with the Red Española de Supercomputación (Spanish Supercomputing Network).</p>
<h3>Hyphens</h3>
<p>The use or non-use of hyphens is a complex issue. The same words may sometimes be considered correct with or without hyphens, such as is the case with email and e-mail. The general tendency, however, is to use them less, especially due to the influence of electronic and social media, where hyphens are often considered superfluous or untidy. There are thousands of examples of recently disappearing hyphens, such as the following recommendations taken from the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
<p>Formerly hyphenated words split in two:</p>
<p>fire drill</p>
<p>ice cream</p>
<p>test tube</p>
<p>Formerly hyphenated words written as one:</p>
<p>pigeonhole</p>
<p>upmarket</p>
<p>waterborne</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary difficulties, we will give only certain basic guidelines.</p>
<h3>Prefixes</h3>
<p>Many words beginning with a prefix are written with a hyphen (co-payment); many are not (overproduction). Confusingly, there are also cases where both forms are considered acceptable (British: pre-school / American: preschool). As can be seen from this last example, the tendency in American English is to hyphenate less than in British English. In any event, if in doubt about whether a prefix should be followed by a hyphen, consult a reliable dictionary. However, the following observations generally hold.</p>
<p>Words beginning with a common prefix (such as un, dis or re) are often written without a hyphen.</p>
<p>Current levels of absenteeism in many subjects are unacceptably high.</p>
<p>Student representatives have disregarded criticism from the Rector, calling it uninformed and unfair.</p>
<p>This initiative reaffirms the strong ties between the two universities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, make sure to hyphenate when the prefix re precedes a word beginning with e, such as re-evaluate, or when the hyphen can help avoid confusion, such as re-sent vs resent or re-sign vs resign.</p>
<p>Hyphenate all words formed by a prefix and a word beginning with a capital letter.</p>
<p>This movement is a pan-European response to failures in education.</p>
<p>The research confirms a growing anti-British sentiment in commercial relations. The trans-Siberian railway attracts many students seeking adventure.</p>
<p>But note that words like transatlantic, transpacific or subarctic are normally written as single words with no capitalisation.</p>
<p>Compound adjectives</p>
<p>Hyphenate compound adjectives before a noun to indicate that the adjectives should be read as a unit, thereby avoiding ambiguity.</p>
<p>small-city mayors [as opposed to city mayors who are small]</p>
<p>a popular-music producer [as opposed to a music producer who is popular]</p>
<p>Although hyphens are only sometimes needed to avoid misunderstanding, hyphenate compound adjectives even when confusion is unlikely.</p>
<p>a little-discussed problem</p>
<p>a low-prevalence phenomenon a well-meaning intervention</p>
<p>However, do not hyphenate compound adjectives in which the first element is an adverb ending in either ly or y.</p>
<p>a compellingly argued paper</p>
<p>a highly detailed research proposal a very engaging argument</p>
<p>Similarly, do not hyphenate compound adjectives in which the first element is a</p>
<p>comparative or superlative.</p>
<p>the most cited research paper</p>
<p>a less complicated suggestion</p>
<p>Phrasal verbs</p>
<p>Nouns formed from phrasal verbs</p>
<p>Nouns formed from phrasal verbs are often written as a single word and may or may not be hyphenated. If in doubt, consult a dictionary.</p>
<p>The dropouts from this course are unusually high.</p>
<p>Funding problems have meant that these projects have been put on standby.</p>
<p>A major follow-up to this study has already been planned.</p>
<p>Last year’s buy-in allowed our faculty to open three new laboratories.</p>
<p>Adjectives formed from phrasal verbs</p>
<p>When a phrasal verb is used as an adjective, it is usually hyphenated.</p>
<p>Students participating in this initiative were given additional information during the signing-on phase.</p>
<p>During the warm-up period, there will be no assessment.</p>
<p>Word breaks</p>
<p>Hyphens can be used to break words up into their component parts to facilitate reading by avoiding doubled letters.</p>
<p>Part-time teaching staff play an increasingly important role in the MA programme.</p>
<p>The Office of Health and Safety’s harm-minimisation strategy was instrumental in reducing the spread of Covid among the staff.</p>
<p>But note that certain high-frequency terms are no longer hyphenated.</p>
<p>Cooperation among participating universities is gradually increasing. Macroeconomic factors have led to considerable modifications in research funding.</p>
<p>Words that are part of a name may be exceptions to this rule.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</p>
<p>Compounds with the same root and different prefixes</p>
<p>When a noun is preceded by more than one hyphenated prefix, write the prefixes as follows.</p>
<p>In a pioneering study, the Department of Psychology is currently researching the pre- and post-natal effects of carbon monoxide.</p>
<h2>PUNCTUATION</h2>
<p>Punctuation is an important aspect of any written text. Good punctuation organises or divides the text to make meaning clearer; poor punctuation will make it difficult to understand.</p>
<p>General guidelines</p>
<p>Use common sense. Punctuation should help make written language clear to readers. If it does not, it should not be there. In line with most modern recommendations on this subject, we recommend light use of punctuation: as much as is necessary but no more.</p>
<h3>Precedence</h3>
<p>Be careful of using two or more punctuation marks in succession. Generally speaking, use the stronger or more necessary one. For example, question and exclamation marks are stronger than commas and full stops. However, quotation marks, brackets and ellipsis points are often used next to other punctuation marks. In the first of the two examples below, the question mark is used instead of the habitual comma and precedes the closing quotation marks; and in the second, a full stop is not needed because the exclamation mark already ends the sentence.</p>
<p>“Have all the results been reported?” asked the researcher. Fees must be paid by 20 December!</p>
<p>Punctuation and spacing</p>
<p>Punctuation marks in English – apart from dashes, ellipsis points, slashes and opening brackets – are always next to the preceding word, without a space.</p>
<p>Slashes are closed up to the preceding word and to the next word when they separate two single words.</p>
<p>and/or male/female</p>
<p>When a slash separates two groups of words or a group of words from a single word, insert a space before and after the slash.</p>
<p>This proposal has been approved / requires further consideration.</p>
<p>Such documents shall be signed by the rector / rector’s delegate, as applicable.</p>
<p>Full stops, question marks, exclamation marks, commas, colons and semicolons are always followed by a single space.</p>
<p>Full stops</p>
<p>Full stops, or points, present few problems. Use them for three main purposes: ending sentences that are not questions or exclamations, punctuating the numbers or letters used to list the elements of a summary, and separating the letters in some, but not all, abbreviations.</p>
<p>Indirect questions</p>
<p>Use a full stop, not a question mark, after an indirect question.</p>
<p>He asked what the requirements were.</p>
<p>Items in lists</p>
<p>Use full stops after the numbers or letters that list the elements of a summary.</p>
<p>Prepare the report.</p>
<p>Send copies to all members.</p>
<p>Punctuate properly.</p>
<p>Write simply.</p>
<p>The individual items in vertical lists should only be followed by full stops when they form complete sentences (as above), not when they are simply nouns or noun phrases (as below).</p>
<p>Bachelor’s degrees</p>
<h3>Law</h3>
<h3>Chemistry</h3>
<p>History of Art</p>
<p>Punctuate information contained in a list written in sentence form with a comma after each item in the list and the conjunction and or or before the last item, which is punctuated with a full stop.</p>

<p>you must have a CEFR B2-level command of English, and</p>
<p>you must submit official transcripts of your undergraduate studies.</p>
<p>If the list consists of sentences punctuated with a full stop, the phrase introducing the list must end in a colon (as in the example) or a full stop.</p>

<h3>Headings</h3>
<p>Do not use full stops at the end of headings.</p>
<p>Doctoral degree requirements</p>
<p>Doctoral students are required to submit at least three progress reports during the first two months of the research period. The templates for these reports can be accessed online.</p>
<p>However, use full stops (not colons) in run-in heads, which should be italicised</p>
<p>or written in boldface to make them stand out.</p>

<p>Sentences ending in abbreviations</p>
<p>If an abbreviation that takes a final point ends a sentence, this final point functions as the full stop.</p>

<h3>Colons</h3>
<p>Use colons to introduce examples, explanations and specifications. In running text, a colon is preceded by a complete sentence; what follows it may or may not be a complete sentence, and may be a list or even a single word.</p>

<p>Common mistakes</p>
<p>Be careful with colons in the following situations.</p>
<p>Instead of a comma</p>
<p>Do not use a colon to substitute a comma.</p>

<p>After a preposition</p>
<p>Do not use colons between a preposition and its complement.</p>
<p>*The Council announced cutbacks in: research funding, international cooperation and staff development.</p>
<p>Two or more colons in a sentence</p>
<p>Never use more than one colon in a sentence.</p>
<p>*The Council’s priorities are controversial: they have been praised and criticised by all groups: PDI, PTGAS and students.</p>
<p>Note, however, that you can use a semicolon and a colon in the same sentence.</p>
<p>The Government cutbacks have been devastating; protests are planned by many people working in the most affected areas: education, healthcare and social services.</p>
<p>Other uses</p>
<p>Titles and subtitles</p>
<p>When you cite the name of a book which has both a title and a subtitle, separate the two with a colon. Do this even though no colon may appear on the cover or the title page of the book itself.</p>

<h3>Ratios</h3>
<p>Ratios can be written with words (two to one) or with numbers and a colon (2:1).</p>
<p>Women outnumbered men by two to one.</p>
<p>The ratio of women to men was 2:1.</p>
<h3>Semicolons</h3>
<p>Main functions</p>
<p>The semicolon is mainly used to join two complete sentences in a single sentence when (a) the two sentences are thought to be too closely related to be separated by a full stop and (b) there is no connecting word which would require a comma, such as and or but.</p>
<p>The Governing Council agreed to the measure; the Student Council rejected it.</p>
<p>Alternatives to the semicolon</p>
<p>Full stop</p>
<p>A semicolon can generally be replaced by a full stop.</p>

<p>However, the semicolon suggests that the two shorter sentences are more closely related than two consecutive sentences.</p>
<p>A connecting word</p>
<p>A semicolon can also be replaced by a suitable connecting word (and, or, but, while, yet) with a joining comma.</p>
<p>The Governing Council agreed to the measure, yet the Student Council rejected it.</p>
<p>However, certain connecting words must be preceded by a semicolon or full stop. The most common are consequently, hence, however, meanwhile, nevertheless, therefore and thus.</p>
<p>The two sides have refused to negotiate; consequently, the measure has been suspended.</p>
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>Use semicolons to separate items in long or complex lists, or to make these items more conspicuous than they would be with commas.</p>
<p>The membership of the committee was as follows: PDI, 4; PTGAS, 5; students, 3.</p>
<h3>Commas</h3>
<p>As a general rule, commas can be used to list items in a series, to join sentences and to set off parenthetical or introductory phrases (for commas in lists in sentence form, see Section 2.2.2 Items in lists).</p>
<p>Listing items in a series</p>
<p>In a list containing a series of items, separate the items with commas. However, a comma should not precede the conjunction before the final item (in other words, write a, b and c and not a, b, and c). But if a comma would make the meaning clearer, use it – especially when one of the items in the list is already joined by and.</p>
<p>Specialist subjects include teaching, research and development, and business applications.</p>
<p>Joining sentences</p>
<p>When you join two complete sentences into a single sentence, you can use commas but follow them with a suitable connecting word: and, or, but, while or yet.</p>
<p>The group members had to hand in their reports last week, but some were only submitted this week.</p>
<p>The comma is not required if the subject of the second part of the sentence is omitted or if the conjunction used is and or or.</p>
<p>The student had to hand in the work by Friday but didn’t make the deadline.</p>
<p>The student had to hand in the work by Friday or the work would receive a failing mark.</p>
<p>Other uses of the comma</p>
<p>Separate a city from a state, province, region or country with a comma.</p>
<h3>Chicago, Illinois Lisbon, Portugal</h3>
<p>Do not use a comma between the month and the year.</p>
<h3>*October, 2001</h3>
<h3>October 2001</h3>
<p>In most numbers of one thousand or more, use commas between groups of three digits.</p>
<p>62,242</p>
<p>1,723</p>
<p>1,000,000</p>
<p>Exceptions are degree temperatures, years, addresses, page numbers and other uses of numbers for a non-quantifying purpose (see Section 5.2.2 Commas).</p>
<p>Misuse of the comma</p>
<p>Do not put a comma between the subject and the verb even if the subject is very long. Therefore, in the sentence below there is no comma between the words own (the end of the long subject) and are (the first word of the verb phrase).</p>
<p>Students who are attracted by the idea of spending a few months studying at a university in a country other than their own are often put off when they realise they will have to attend lectures in a foreign language.</p>
<h3>Dashes</h3>
<p>A dash is similar in appearance to a hyphen but is longer and used differently.</p>
<p>Use it with spaces to make a parenthetical reference.</p>
<p>This morning’s lecture – rescheduled from last week – was given by Professor Mulligan.</p>
<p>Use it without spaces to express a connection or to indicate a date, time or number range.</p>
<p>Girona–Barcelona bus</p>
<p>staff–student relationship</p>
<p>2007–2010</p>
<p>3.00–7.30 p.m.</p>
<p>40–50 students</p>
<p>Ranges can be expressed by a dash or by the words from and to (or between and and) but never by a combination of from (or between) and a dash.</p>

<p>The Arabic discussion group will meet from 3 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. on Thursdays.</p>
<h3>Brackets</h3>
<p>Round brackets</p>
<p>Round brackets are primarily used in four situations.</p>
<p>Secondary or marginal information</p>
<p>Use round brackets to indicate information that is secondary or marginal to the main idea of the sentence.</p>
<p>The documentary was produced by Spotlight Films (a production company connected to the University’s film school).</p>
<p>Explanations or abbreviations of preceding information</p>
<p>Use round brackets to expand on or explain preceding information.</p>
<p>EU-OSH (the European workplace safety and health agency) works to ensure that these regulations are respected.</p>
<p>The project was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>When a passage within round brackets is at the end of a sentence, of which it is only a part, place the full stop after the closing bracket. However, when the bracketed passage is a complete sentence, place the full stop before the opening bracket and then add a second full stop before the closing bracket.</p>
<p>The number of students entering arts degrees is declining (according to recent reports).</p>
<p>The number of students entering arts degrees is declining. (According to recent reports, it has dropped by over 25% in the last nine years.)</p>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>Use round brackets to represent options.</p>
<p>Please write your surname(s) in block capitals.</p>
<p>The opinions of the author(s) are not shared by the publisher(s).</p>
<p>Enumerations in a body of text</p>
<p>Use round brackets to enclose numerals or letters in an enumeration in the body of a text. Use roman type rather than italics for the numerals and letters.</p>
<p>A project proposal should include (1) a description of the project, (2) an identification of the target audience, (3) an explanation of why the project deserves funding and (4) a comparison with similar projects implemented in recent years.</p>
<p>The preview of your class paper should include (a) an abstract, (b) a sample of each chapter, (c) a selected bibliography and (d) details on funding.</p>
<p>Square brackets</p>
<p>Square brackets are less common than round brackets. They are primarily used in three situations.</p>
<p>Clarifications within quoted text</p>
<p>Use square brackets to set off a clarification within quoted text.</p>
<p>The Rector said of the coming budget debate, “Never in all my years as rector have I had to make such a difficult decision about such a useful programme [grants for young researchers] affecting so many”.</p>
<p>Optional or tentative text</p>
<p>Use square brackets to indicate text that is optional or still open to discussion. In the following example, the School of Education is responsible for implementing the project. What is optional or uncertain is whether the Office of External Relations will share that responsibility.</p>
<p>The implementation of the project will be the [joint] responsibility of the School of Education [and the Office of External Relations].</p>
<p>Brackets within brackets</p>
<p>Use square brackets to indicate parenthetical elements that are already in round brackets.</p>
<p>A large multilateral organisation (e.g., the World Bank [WB]) has the following characteristics…</p>
<p>Question marks</p>
<p>Direct questions</p>
<p>Place a question mark at the end of any sentence that is a direct question.</p>
<p>Who wrote that report?</p>
<p>If the question is a direct quotation repeating the speaker’s exact words, a question mark is still used.</p>
<p>“Who wrote that report?” she asked.</p>
<p>Other types of question</p>
<p>Indirect questions</p>
<p>Do not use a question mark in an indirect question, in which the speaker’s exact words are not repeated. Use only a full stop, since the whole sentence is now a statement.</p>
<p>She asked who had written that report.</p>
<p>Courtesy questions</p>
<p>If a request or instruction is put as a question for reasons of courtesy, do not use a question mark.</p>
<p>Would you please fill in and sign the attached application and submit it before the end of the month.</p>
<p>Quotation marks</p>
<p>Use quotation marks, also called inverted commas, to indicate direct quotations and definitions.</p>
<p>Before bestowing the award, the Rector said, “Dr Robinson’s efforts to oppose discrimination place him among the few who actually deserve such an honour.”</p>
<p>According to this dictionary, a methodology is “a body of methods, rules and postulates employed by a discipline”.</p>
<p>As in the examples above, punctuation should be placed according to the meaning: if it belongs to the quotation, it is quoted; otherwise, it is not.</p>
<p>According to the Dean, “The need for structural change is paramount.” The Dean declared that the need for structural change was “paramount”.</p>
<p>Although there is a diversity of guidance in this respect, we recommend using double marks for a quotation and single marks for a quotation within a quotation.</p>
<p>“His office door is very unusual; it has ‘Welcome’ written all over it in more than thirty different languages.”</p>
<p>Quotations of over four lines in length should be set off from the text as a block quotation, not enclosed in quotation marks, and single-spaced. Quoted matter within the block quotation is set off with double quotation marks; quotations within these quotations, with single quotation marks.</p>
<p>Single quotation marks can also help show the reader that a word or term is used in an unusual, colloquial or ironic way.</p>
<p>Nature somehow ‘knows’ the best environmental course to take.</p>
<p>The students felt ‘ripped off’ by the lecturer’s decision to hold the exam a week earlier than scheduled.</p>
<p>That lecturer is famous for sharing her ‘wisdom’ with her students.</p>
<p>Also, use quotation marks for titles of chapters in books, articles in periodicals,</p>
<p>and TV and radio programmes.</p>
<p>Exclamation marks</p>
<p>An exclamation mark is used at the end of a short phrase or a sentence that expresses very strong feeling. It is one way of adding emphasis and in our institutional context it may be used in public announcements of certain kinds, university relations and advertising.</p>
<p>Sign up now! More funding for research and development!</p>
<p>However, exclamation marks are very rare in formal English, so use them sparingly. Finally, never use more than one exclamation mark in a row.</p>

<h3>Apostrophes</h3>
<p>In general, we use apostrophes to indicate possession or contracted forms.</p>
<p>Possessive forms of nouns</p>
<p>The possessive form of a singular noun is marked by an apostrophe followed by s.</p>
<p>the manager’s report  the lecturer’s hypothesis</p>
<p>This rule applies in most cases even with a name ending in s.</p>
<p>the PTGAS’s response Erasmus’s success</p>
<p>If a plural noun already ends in s, the apostrophe is used alone.</p>
<p>the students’ work (several students) the teachers’ room (all the teachers)</p>
<p>Note that the apostrophe is also used in expressions of time.</p>
<p>eight weeks’ time yesterday’s meeting</p>
<p>Degree types should be written with an apostrophe followed by s.</p>
<p>bachelor’s degree master’s degree</p>
<p>But note the exception doctoral degree (not doctor’s degree).</p>
<p>Do not use apostrophes to indicate a decade, a plural acronym or the plurals of figures.</p>
<p>*the 1990’s</p>
<p>the 1990s</p>
<p>*URL’s</p>
<p>URLs</p>
<p>*747’s</p>
<p>747s</p>
<h3>Contractions</h3>
<p>Use apostrophes for contractions (you’re for you are, don’t for do not, it’s for it is or it has), but note that contractions are far less common in formal texts than they are in informal writing.</p>
<p>Ellipsis points</p>
<p>Use ellipsis points with a space on either side to denote pauses. Use them at the end of a sentence without a space to indicate that the sentence has been left unfinished.</p>
<p>“This morning’s lecture was … very interesting.”</p>
<p>The lecturer warned her students, “The reports are due next Friday. If I don’t get them…”</p>
<p>Use ellipsis points with square brackets to denote words missing from a direct quotation.</p>
<p>The Rector said, “Preston [...] transmitted values through his books [...] and enabled us to understand the present and look to the future.”</p>
<p>Do not use ellipsis points to indicate an incomplete list.</p>
<p>*This unit deals with promotion, advertising, outreach… This unit deals with promotion, advertising, outreach, etc.</p>
